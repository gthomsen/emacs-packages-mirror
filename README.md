# Overview
Small fragments of Emacs packages suitable for inclusion into projects.  This
serves to provide a home for code that doesn't otherwise exist in a Git
repository as well as mirror small pieces of code that live in significantly
larger repositories (e.g. Emacs, ELPA, emacswiki.org, etc).

Everything here has its own README.md explaining where it came from and its
licensing.  See specific packages for details.
